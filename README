AGENDA

Tom is going to parse a few PDF files in a few different ways each,
and you're going to ask him questions so that he doesn't get boring.

1. Looking through a large body of PDFs (wetlands permit application notices)
  * ls, &c.
  * pdftotext
  * pdfimages
2. Doing silly keyword searches
  * pdfimages and tesseract
  * grep with regular expressions
3. Inspecting the structure of a PDF (both wetlands and Scarsdale)
  * pdftohtml and open a web browser
  * Inkscape

The basic approach is pretty much always going to be to convert the PDF
to some sort of plain text and then to use typical text-parsing methods.

PACKAGES TO INSTALL

poppler-utils (pdfinfo, pdftotext, and pdftohtml)

* On GNU/Linux, your package manager probably has it.
* On Windows, you try http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/

pdftk

* On GNU/Linux, your package manager probably has it.
* On windows, try https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/

Inkscape

* On GNU/Linux, your package manager probably has it.
* On Windows, try http://inkscape.org/en/download/windows/

Tesseract

* On GNU/Linux, your package manager probably has it.
* On Windows, try https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/ReadMe

PROGRAMS

From most lossy to least lossy

1. Basic file analysis tools (ls or another language's equivalent)
2. PDF metadata tools (pdfinfo or an equivalent)
3. pdftotext
4. pdftohtml -xml
5. Inkscape (maybe via pdf2svg)
6. Things like PDFMiner

Things for OCR

1. pdfimages
2. tesseract
3. There's probably some fancier thing just for PDFs, but I haven't used it.
4. convert (from ImageMagick) for converting image formats

Other things to look at

* Tabula
* Overview
* Itext

OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT

There are all sorts of ways of encoding data in PDF files, so it's not like
there's a straightforward PDF-to-spreadsheet conversion. (This is just like
any other file format.) Figure out what data you want to extract from the
files, and select your parsing strategy accordingly.

And if it seems like too much work to get exactly what you want, try to come
up with something else that is easier to extract and that will still tell you
something similar.

Finally, it's quite hard to convert data formats without losing information,
so don't worry about losing information. You can always write a new parser
for any other information that you want.
