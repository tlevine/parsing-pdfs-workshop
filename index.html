<h1>Parsing PDFs (workshop)</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  Much of the world's data are stored in portable document format (PDF) files.
  This is not my preferred storage or presentation format, so I often convert
  such files into databases, graphs, or spreadsheets. When I'm reading PDF
  files, I ask these questions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do we need to read the file contents at all?</li>
  <li>Do we only need to extract the text and/or images?</li>
  <li>Do we care about the layout of the file?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I take different approaches to parsing depending on the answers to these
  questions. I'll show a few different approaches to parsing and analyzing PDF
  files, and I'll discuss which approaches make sense in which situations. 
  And we'll try parsing some PDF files.
</p>

<h2>Before the workshop</h2>
<p>
  You are going to learn how to tell computers take information out of
  PDF files. <strong>If there is a PDF file that you want to read, bring it</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, install as many of the following packages as you can.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>poppler-utils</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>poppler-utils</code>.</li>
      <li>On Windows, you try
          <a href="http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/">poppler-windows</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
