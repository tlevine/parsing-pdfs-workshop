<h1>Parsing PDFs (workshop)</h1>
<p>
  Here are some things you might like to know before you show up to one
  of the workshops I'm giving during the week of October 20 on parsing PDF
  files.
</p>
<p>
  You don't need any particular computer skills to attend the workshop;
  as long as you are vaguely interested in the topic of converting data
  formats, you'll get something out of the workshop.
</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  Much of the world's data are stored in portable document format (PDF) files.
  This is not my preferred storage or presentation format, so I often convert
  such files into databases, graphs, or spreadsheets. When I'm reading PDF
  files, I ask these questions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do we need to read the file contents at all?</li>
  <li>Do we only need to extract the text and/or images?</li>
  <li>Do we care about the layout of the file?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I take different approaches to parsing depending on the answers to these
  questions. I'll show a few different approaches to parsing and analyzing PDF
  files, and I'll discuss which approaches make sense in which situations. 
  And we'll try parsing some PDF files.
</p>

<h2>Before the workshop</h2>
<p>
  You are going to learn how to tell computers take information out of
  PDF files. <strong>If there is a PDF file that you want to read, bring it</strong>.

  Also, install as many of the following packages as you can.
  If you are using a GNU/Linux distribution, they're probably in your
  package manager (<code>apt-get</code>, <code>rpm</code>, or
  <code>pacman</code>, for example). If you're using Windows, try
  downloading things from the links and installing them.

<dl>
  <dt>poppler-utils</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>poppler-utils</code>.</li>
      <li>On Windows, you try
          <a href="http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/">poppler-windows</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>pdftk</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>pdftk</code>. It is a bit old, so it sometimes isn't on newer distributions.</li>
      <li>On windows, try https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Inkscape</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
        <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>inkscape</code>.</li>
        <li>On Windows, follow <a href="http://inkscape.org/en/download/windows/">these directions</a></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Tesseract</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>tesseract</code> or <code>tesseract-ocr</code>. In addition, you can install the Albanian data package, which might be called <code>tesseract-data-sqi<code>.</li>
      <li>On Windows, follow
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/ReadMe">these directions</a></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  All of the programs that we're going to use are going to be run from
  text shells. We'll show you how to do that if you don't know how to;
  just try not to get scared if you haven't done that before.
