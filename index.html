<h1>Parsing PDFs (workshop)</h1>
<p>
  Here are some things you might like to know before you show up to one
  of the workshops I'm giving during the week of October 20 on parsing PDF
  files.
</p>
<p>First, here are the workshops.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1484286535169810/">BarCamp Prizren #13</a>, 21 October</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/830342177011044/">Takim lokal (Meet-up) për OPEN DATA</a>, 22 October</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/557965621099116/">BarCamp Gjilan #8</a>, 23 October</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/638428556272332/">BarCamp Prishtina #25</a>, 24 October</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you are somewhat comfortable with programming, you'll pick up specific
  techniques for parsing PDF files. If you aren't, you'll still get a
  high-level introduction to the conversion of data formats.
  You don't need any particular computer skills to attend the workshop;
  as long as you are vaguely interested in the topic of converting data
  formats, you'll get something out of the workshop.
</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  Much of the world's data are stored in portable document format (PDF) files.
  This is not my preferred storage or presentation format, so I often convert
  such files into databases, graphs, or spreadsheets. When I'm reading PDF
  files, I ask these questions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do we need to read the file contents at all?</li>
  <li>Do we only need to extract the text and/or images?</li>
  <li>Do we care about the layout of the file?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I take different approaches to parsing depending on the answers to these
  questions. I'll show a few different approaches to parsing and analyzing PDF
  files, and I'll discuss which approaches make sense in which situations. 
  And we'll try parsing some PDF files.
</p>

<h2>Before the workshop</h2>
<p>
  You are going to learn how to tell computers take information out of
  PDF files. <strong>If there is a PDF file that you want to read, bring it</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Also, install at least one of the following packages.
  (It would be good if you installed all of them, but we won't have time
  during the workshop for you to try out all of them.)
  If you are using a GNU/Linux distribution, they're probably in your
  package manager (<code>apt-get</code>, <code>rpm</code>, or
  <code>pacman</code>, for example). If you're using Windows, try
  downloading things from the links and installing them.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>poppler-utils</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>poppler-utils</code>.</li>
      <li>On Windows, you try
          <a href="http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/">poppler-windows</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>pdftk</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>pdftk</code>. It is a bit old, so it sometimes isn't on newer distributions.</li>
      <li>On windows, try https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Inkscape</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
        <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>inkscape</code>.</li>
        <li>On Windows, follow <a href="http://inkscape.org/en/download/windows/">these directions</a></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Tesseract</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>On GNU/Linux, the package is probably called <code>tesseract</code> or <code>tesseract-ocr</code>. In addition, you can install the Albanian data package, which might be called <code>tesseract-data-sqi</code>.</li>
      <li>On Windows, follow
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/ReadMe">these directions</a></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>An XML parser</dt>
  <dd>
    Figure out how to parse XML files in whatever programming language
    you are used to.
    <a href="http://thomaslevine.com/!/xml-parsers/">This list</a>
    will get you started.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  All of the programs that we're going to use are going to be run from
  text shells. We'll show you how to do that if you don't know how to;
  just try not to get scared if you haven't done that before.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, you may download the materials that I'm using for the workshop.
</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:tlevine/parsing-pdfs-workshop</code></pre>
